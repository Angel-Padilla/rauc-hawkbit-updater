Release 1.2 (in development)
----------------------------

Release 1.1 (released Nov 15, 2021)
-----------------------------------

.. rubric:: Enhancements

* RAUC hawkBit Updater does now handle hawkBit cancellation requests.
  This allows to cancel deployments that were not yet
  received/downloaded/installed.
  Once the installation has begun, cancellations are rejected. [#89]
* RAUC hawkBit Updater now explicitly rejects deployments with multiple
  chunks/artifacts as these are conceptually unsupported by RAUC. [#103]
* RAUC hawkBit Updater now implements waiting and retrying when receiving
  HTTP errors 409 (Conflict) or 429 (Too Many Requests) on DDI API calls.
  [#102]
* Enable TCP keep-alive probing to recognize and deal with connection outages
  earlier. [#101]
* New configuration options ``low_speed_time`` and ``low_speed_time`` allow
  to adjust the detection of slow connections to match the expected
  environmental conditions. [#101]
* A new option ``resume_downloads`` allows to configure RAUC hawkBit Updater
  to resume aborted downloads if possible. [#101]
* RAUC hawkBit Updater now evaluates the deployment API's 'skip' options for
  download and update (as e.g. used for maintenance window handling).
  Depending on what attributes are set, this will skip installation after
  download or even the entire update. [#111]

.. rubric:: Testing

* replaced manual injection of temporary env modification by monkeypatch
  fixture
* test cases for all new features were added

.. rubric:: Documentation

* Added note on requirements for storage location when using plain bundle
  format
